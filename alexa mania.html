            <p><big>It has been confirmed that Alexa Bliss will be defending her Smackdown Women's Championship against every avalible women on Smackdown's roster.</big></p>
            <p><big>It's not been revealed who exaclty will be in the match, but I think we can presume that former champion Becky Lynch will be included. And I think it's safe to say that Mickie James, Carmella and Natalya will all be invloved as well.</big></p>
            <p><big>But will we see the return of former champion Naomi? Naomi won the championship after defeating Alexa at Elimination Chamber in Feburary, but she had to vacate the title nine days later due to a knee injury. The title was then claimed again by Alexa. Wrestlemania is being held in Naomi's hometown of Orlando, Florida, so it's likely that if Naomi is cleared by April 2nd she will probably be in the match.</big></p>
            <p><big>Can we also expect to see Tamina in this match? She was competing in some Smackdown house shows earlier this week at Madison Square Garden. Tamina hasn't been seen since May due to injury.</big></p>
            <p><big>And what about Eva Marie? She was drafted to Smackdown back in July has been on a hiatus since August after being suspended for 30 days for violating the company's wellness policy and due to filming a movie.</big></p>
            <p><big>It is Wrestlemania though, and as we know, anything can happen.</big></p>
