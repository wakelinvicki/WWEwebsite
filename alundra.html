        <p><big>On the night of Dec. 18, 1995, Alundra Blayze walked onto the set of WCW’s Nitro with her WWE Women’s Championship in hand and proceeded to dump the title in a garbage can on live television.</big></p>
        <p><big>At a time when WCW had the advantage over WWE in the storied Monday Night War, the incident was a cannonball through the front gates of Mr. McMahon’s crumbling empire. Not only had another one of his competitors aligned themselves with the competition, but a WWE title had been publically disgraced.</big></p>
        <p><big>She broke out as a competitor on American soil in 1993 when she joined WWE as the face of a revamped Women’s Championship. Defeating Heidi Lee Morgan to win the vacant title, Blayze introduced the physical Japanese style to the States through a series of grisly bouts against Nakano and Kong.</big></p>
        <p><big>When interest in the Women’s Championship waned, WWE disbanded the division and released all female competitors including Blayze, who was still the WWE Women's Champion. Blayze was immediately hired by WCW where she would finish out her ring career once again as Madusa. Following her controversial dumping of the title, she battled dangerous opponents like Akira Hokuto and Luna Vachon, linked up with “Macho Man” Randy Savage and even defeated Evan Karagias to win the WCW Cruiserweight Title.</big></p>
        <p><big>Blayze was honored for her illustrious career when she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on the eve of Wrestlemania 31. Blayze retired from the ring in 2001 after nearly two decades as one of the most revered women in all of wrestling. As for the original WWE Women’s Title? She’s still holding onto it.</big></p>
