            <p><big>We already know that Raw Women's Champion Bayley is going to be defending her championship against both Charlotte and Sasha Banks at Wrestlemania 33, but there now may be a change to the match. Apparently the original plan was to be a Fatal 4 Way with Nia Jax included but that could still be happening. Recent talk is that either Nia or Dana Brooke could added to the title match.</big></p>
            <p><big>On March 13th's episode of Raw we finally saw Dana Brooke stand up to Charlotte after months and months of the former champion being extremely nasty to her protege, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see Dana added to the match.</big></p>
            <p><big>And Nia Jax has been a very strong competitor in Raw's women's division since she came up from NXT last summer as part of the brand split draft. She has had lots of strong wins over Alicia Fox, Bayley and Sasha Banks so she wouldn't be a surprise either, espcially since she was part of the inital plan for the match.</big></p>
            <p><big>We'll just have to wait for Sunday April 2nd to find out.</big></p>
